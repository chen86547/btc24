Create a capital account

The exchange must open a bank account in advance to provide support for multi-currency trading business. Brokers need to apply for an account with a bank or financial institution that provides relevant businesses to provide traders with access to legal funds. Taking into account the security of funds, this institution must have high credibility and be subject to strict supervision.

Build a trading platform

Cryptocurrency, as a digital asset, usually runs smart contracts through code to complete transactions, and ensures the security of funds through digital signature technology. Brokers must first build a front-end trading platform and access cryptocurrency liquidity to support multi-currency transactions such as BTC and ETH. The trading platform needs to include a matching engine to match buy and sell orders to complete transactions. Secondly, it is necessary to establish a hot and cold wallet and a multi-signature mechanism in the platform. Traders only store a small portion of the funds to be bought and sold in the hot wallet, and digitally sign both parties during the transaction. This can prevent risks such as hacker intrusions and protect the security of digital assets. In addition to this, cryptocurrencies are less liquid. Unlike other investment assets such as stocks, cryptocurrency will suffer from liquidity crunch and sharp price changes when market fluctuations occur. Therefore, the exchange also needs to establish a back-end management system. Including real-time transaction data detection to manage transaction risks.

Establish an exchange management system

The first is the compliance system. KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) are compliance procedures that cryptocurrency exchanges must complete. The former is an integral part of the latter, which is a broader anti-money laundering process, primarily to verify customer identity. Exchanges must strictly implement these two self-regulatory processes.

The second is the customer management system. After a crypto-asset exchange is established, it may accept a large number of investors, and brokers need to hire professional personnel to provide technical support for customers' transactions, such as conducting transaction data analysis, etc. At the same time, the cryptocurrency trading market also operates throughout the day. Therefore, exchanges need to provide 24/7 trading services to customers.
